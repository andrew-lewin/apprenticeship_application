This is a small app for my application for the apprenticeship program at MX. It is written in rails 4.2.3 and ruby 2.2.1. The about page is my actual application, but it also allows a user to sign in to be able to leave a fake suggstion for the support team. Only the user that submitted the suggestion will be able to delete it.
